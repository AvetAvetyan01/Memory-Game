# Memory-Game
This is a game where we are given unfolded cards on a playing field and we have to make all the cards disappear by guessing the matching cards. If 2 selected cards match then they disappear from the field. The game ends in two cases ` 1. If the time runs out (then the player loses), 2. If all the cards in the field disappear (then the player wins).
